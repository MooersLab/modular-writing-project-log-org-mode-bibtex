## Template for the modular form of the writing project log file in org-mode for use with BibTeX

The template imports select workflows and protocols from a central folder.
This enables customization of the log file for the project at hand.
The protocols can be updated in a central location for all projects that source the protocol file.
The org-mode `#+INCLUDE:` command or the LaTeX `\input` commands are used.
The included files can be written in LaTeX or org-mode.
Variant protocols for specific subgroups of projects can be swamped for the standard protocols.
A protocol folder with the workflow protocols is included for inspiration.
